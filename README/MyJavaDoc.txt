Welcome, Grader!!
You don't have to read this!
*** indicates the note is a little important...

* -- FORMATTING THE SR FILE: NOTES -- *
In this folder, you will find an example of my .sr file
Please format your file like this.

-- STATS
">" indicates the start of a stat ***
The only stats that exist are the five listed.
My example .sr file already has some stats. I'm not sure if you
will use it to run my program, but if you do, then your stats will be
added to those stats.
Any other fake, made up stat that you decide to include will cause
an exception to be thrown.
"{ User Stats }" is just a header for the stats, or like a label.
You don't HAVE to include it, but it does look nice.

-- QUESTIONS (and difficulty)
Questions, as stated in PA02, must be in double brackets, question and answer
separated with ":::" whitespace does not matter.
If you choose to give a question a difficulty, you must do (E) or (H) ***
after the question's answer.
Whitespace also does not matter here.

* -- RUNNING THE PROGRAM -- *

-- VALID FILE PATH
Please enter a valid file path when prompted.
If you don't, an exception will be thrown and the program will stop.
No study session for you. If you choose to do this, that's okay, just
expect the exception.
I chose to have invalid file paths handled by java.

-- CHOOSING AN OPTION
Options will show up AFTER you answer a question. You must answer ***
the question. It doesn't matter what your answer is.
PLEASE choose a VALID option. If you don't you will be prompted to
choose again.

* -- OTHER GENERAL NOTES -- *

FileFormatter is a PA01 class, many methods were added in order to ***
implement PA02 while also reusing PA01 code/methods. You should probably
grade the methods that I added (I indicated which ones are new/adjusted).

-- TESTING
Many of my methods call other methods, so sometimes there is no reason to
test them. But I have tried/have covered them all. ("have" if I remember to
come back and update this file)
